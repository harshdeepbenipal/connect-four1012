Project Title: Connect 4

Project Description:

The game is gonna be a player 1 and player 2 design with the option to play against the computer. The connect board has 7 columns and 6 rows. In which the user is given the choice to add their coloured chip to one of the 7 columns within a certain amount of time determined by the difficulty chosen at the start. The board will use 2 dimensional arrays, loops, and conditional statements to determine both the validity of the userâ€™s input, and determine the winner. The win will be determined by whether the user or computer has 4 pieces in either a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line. The visual concept behind the connect 4 will be either yellow and red chips or chip designed on an image capture of the player if they choose to do so. 

 Functional Requirements:
 
  - The languages being used are HTML, CSS, Javascript.
  -  there will be a button that goes to a screen where they are told the controls and how to play the game like how to place chips
  -  ther will be a button that lets you go and drag or take a picture of your chips(expanded on further)
  - there will be two screens one where the user can choose between game mdoe/options and then event driven through JavaScript using HTML buttons, the game options will be computer vs player and player vs player
  - Ability to set a custom photo as chip icon through HTML, CSS and JavaScript to store the image from the end user-input
  - Designs the connect board using CSS
  - they can place chips by clicking a button on top of each columnn(might be slighly altered during design)
  - on the side of the screen there will be a box showing whose turn it is and what player 1 chip is displayed as and what player 2 chip is displayed as 
  - Users are able to see the winner in an alert
  - Computer choices for chip drops in the game will be determined by an algorithm of arrays in JavaScript where it will check a random spot in the array if it is filled and when it finds an empty spot it will place a chip and stop randomizing within the array
  - When player hovers over column css will display chip above the column and then when a columnn is selected by the user the program will go through the columnn with an array to fill the spot with a chip where it is not filled on the array when they click on the screen where the chip image is hovering
  - When there is no space for a chip inside a colummn, an error through an alert that will tell the user that there is no spaces left to put a chip and tell them to play a different columnn
  - When a winner is determined all chips other than the 4 winning chips will be set not visible through arrays that will be checked each time a chip is displayed inside a box/circle.
  - where there is no winner meaning that the board is filled with no winning solutions left the array will be checked and if the board is filled it will display a alert that tells the user it is a tie and gives the option for play again or return to main menu
  - At the end of each game there will be a alert that pops up that gives the user options to play again and the board will reset or to choose a new mode and return to the main menu.
