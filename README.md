Project Title: Connect 4

Project Description:

The game is gonna be a player 1 and player 2 design with the option to play against the computer on easy, medium, hard difficulty. The connect board has 7 columns and 6 rows. In which the user is given the choice to add their coloured chip to one of the 7 columns within a certain amount of time determined by the difficulty chosen at the start. The board will use 2 dimensional arrays, loops, and conditional statements to determine both the validity of the userâ€™s input, and determine the winner. The win will be determined by whether the user or computer has 4 pieces in either a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line. The visual concept behind the connect 4 will be either yellow and red chips or chip designed on an image capture of the player if they choose to do so.
